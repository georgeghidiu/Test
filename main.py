# Write a function for each subtask
# Task 1.
# Write a Python program to create a list containing the following
# numbers: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50.
#               sub-task1: Print the list.

# Task 2.
# Given the list
#       numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50],
#
#       write a Python program to:
#       sub-task2: Print the first element of the list.
#       sub-task4: Print the third element of the list.
#       sub-task5: Change the second element of the list to 25 and print the updated list.
#       sub-task6: Insert the number 15 at the second position in the list

# Task 3.
# Given the list
#       matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8], [9, 10]],
#
#       write a Python program to:
#       sub-task7: Print the second element of the second list.
#       sub-task8: Print all the elements from the first, third and last list.

# Task 4.
# Write a Python program to create a dictionary with the following key-value pairs
#       sub-task9: Print the dictionary
# Given the following dictionary
#       person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "city": "New York"},
#
#       write a Python program to:
#       sub-task9: Print the value associated with the key "name".
#       sub-task10: Print the value associated with the key "age".
#       sub-task11: Print the value of the "city" key using the get() method.

# Task 5.
# Write a Python program that takes a list of fruits:
#       fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "banana", "apple"]

#       sub-task12: Create a dictionary that counts the number of occurrences of each fruit, resulting in:
#           {"apple": 3, "banana": 2, "cherry": 1}
